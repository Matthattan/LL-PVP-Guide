                <h2 id="What">What is a Set?</h2>
                <p>A set is a specific composure of TP’s, Personalities and items. 
                    The way your Loomian plays and performs in battle will depend on what set you’re using.
                </p>
                <h2 id="Where">Where can I make Sets?</h2>
                <p>Many programs available online for making sets have been listed in Resources 
                    however there are many more on the internet.
                </p>
                <h2 id="Why">Why should I make Sets?</h2>
                <p>By analyzing a Loomian’s capabilities, you can choose where to put Training Points, 
                    select the optimal personality for the role intended, decide on a specialized movement set and much more. 
                    This can give you an edge in certain match-ups and surprise your opponent by running something unexpected. 
                    Of course, not all unconventional sets will perform to the same viability so make sure your reason for running a set is greatly justified. 
                </p>
            </section>
            <!-- How do I make a set? -->
            <section>
                <h2 id="How">How do I make a Set?</h2>
                <p>Though there isn’t set rules when choosing how to run a Loomian, 
                    there are some suggested guidelines: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Base your set around level 50. 
                            The standard for competitive battles is level 50, this means 8 Training Points (or 4 if they’re in Energy) 
                            and 2 Unique Points are equal to 1 total stat point.
                        </li>
                        <li>Try not to force a Loomian to take on multiple roles. 
                            You may end up stretching its entire arsenal utilities so thin that it can’t perform any of its roles well. 
                            Instead, try to focus on a singular role.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Create purposeful sets by justifying your investments; consider a Loomian's base stats and movepool. 
                            Avoid vague reasoning like "to tank hits." You can use the damage calculator to simulate matchups, ensuring optimal point investment for survival, outspeeding, or achieving knockouts.
                        </li>
                        <li>Understand how a role affects Training Points, Personalities, Item, Moveset etc. 
                            An offensive role such as a Cleaner is likely to invest a lot into its dominant attacking stat and speed however a Wall would prefer maximizing its health and defenses. 
                            Many Loomians have explicitly high stats which make it easier to understand how it can be used within the competitive scene.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Analyze the meta -  by understanding which Loomians are being used the most and others which are not seeing usage, you can evaluate if your choices for set making are valid. 
                            If you were in a meta with lots of offensive water types, would making a defensive set for a fire type be worth it?
                        </li>
                        <li>Test your sets out - simulators are pretty powerful tools however they can’t substitute the real thing. 
                            There may be a matchup you forgot to check or an investment simply wasn’t worth it. 
                            By using sets in actual battles, it can prove more useful or, if not, show what can be improved. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

            <!--Set Examples-->

                <h2 id="SetExamples">Set Examples</h2>
                <!-- Offensive Set Example -->
                <button class="panel" id="OffensiveSet">Offensive Set Example</button>
                <div class="panel2">
                    <p>In order to show an easy method for making offensive sets, we will be using an Arceros - introduced in Atlanthian Part 2.</p>
                    <h3>Base Stats</h3>
                    <p>A glance at Arceros’ base stats show an excellent Melee Attack stat of 119, an above average health stat of 91, a high Energy stat of 115 and an amazing Melee Defense of 112. 
                        On the other hand, Arceros has a Ranged Attack stat of 63 and a measly Ranged Defense stat of 59. 
                        Its speed sits at a usable 91.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In summary, Arceros’ offensive pressure is quite potent given its Speed, Energy and Melee Attack. 
                        It also has the feature of living many melee hits due to its decent health and high Melee Defense. 
                        Its Ranged Attack and Ranged Defense should not be relied upon, on the contrary, because of their sub-optimal reach. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Type Effectiveness</h3>
                    <p>The type effectiveness of Arceros shows 4 weaknesses (Light, Air, Earth and Ancient), 4 Resistances (Ice, Electric, Bug and Spirit) and 2 Major resistances (Fire and Plant). 
                        Ancient, Light and Air types like Zuelong, Novadeaus, Charonyx and Stratusoar are ranged attackers so this weakness can be avoided quite easily. 
                        The resistances can help against some matchups like Harvesect, Joltooth or Searknight however they do have moves enabling them to break through this resistance.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Personality</h3>
                    <p>One important feature to note about Arceros is, because it's a Roaming, it only has access to wild personalities i.e Pure Smart, Brawny Foolish etc. 
                        Normally, you would make use of Rally Ranch to obtain a Totemised personality however since this isn’t possible, a wild personality will be chosen instead. 
                        Nimble will be used to increase speed which will be further explained in the Training Points section.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Ability</h3>
                    <p>Arceros has a single default ability called Burning Rage which increases the damage dealt by the possessor’s fire type moves by 50%. 
                        On the other hand, the secret ability Third-Degree Burns causes opposing Loomians who are burned to lose twice the amount of health at the end of every turn while they’re on the field. 
                        Furthermore, All of the possessor’s moves have a 10% chance to burn its target. 
                        We’ve made the choice to go ahead with Burning Rage because the 50% damage output is far more appreciated than the slight chance of being burned.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Movepool</h3>
                    <p>Given we know Arceros will be using its Melee Attack, a focus on Melee Moves should be made. 
                        Usually, Loomians will have 2 reserved spots for each of their ATB (Attack Type Boost) moves and Arceros is no different: Boiling Press and Primal Slash will be used for their decent base strength, 100% accuracy and usable energy costs. 
                        Other moves could have been considered such as Outburst or Flaming kick however due to inconsistent damage output and sub-par accuracy, respectively, they will not be used. 
                        The only form of recovery present on Arceros is Slumber so the decision to not run a defensive set is made here as it can appear forced. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Nearly all Loomians, whether they are offensive or defensive, appreciate a set-up move to exert offensive pressure; no Loomian wants to become fodder. 
                        Bulk Up will be used due to increasing Melee Attack and Melee Defensive - two great stats of Arceros. 
                    </p>
                    <p>As Arceros’ fourth move, Raging Tackle has been chosen to avoid being walled by the likes of Eleguana, Luminami and Tiklipse. 
                        While this move can deal a lot of damage back in recoil, this does give limit swap-ins thereby raising its offensive pressure. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Training Points</h3>
                    <p>Arceros’ TP distribution is quite simple, partly because of its offensive role. 
                        200 TPs will be given to the Melee Attacking stat to do as much damage as possible, another 200 TPs is allocated to speed which enables Arceros to outspeed Nimble Shawchi and Zepholen. 
                        Though Arceros only needs 192 TPs to get to a total stat of 154 and outspeed Nimble Shawchi at level 50, the extra 8 TPs can offer the ability to speedtie other nimble Arceroses. 
                        Nevertheless, this isn’t a huge waste of Training Points.
                    </p>
                    <p>With 100 Training Points remaining, we can have a look at the Energy Stat and come up with an effective energy creep. 
                        Using a calculator and summing various combinations of moves/energy costs reveal that 68 Energy gets Arceros up to 300 total points allowing it to use 3 Boiling Presses and 2 Primal slashes before needing to regain energy. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Finally, the 32 training points can be given to the health stat as it's great for increasing bulk with leftover points. 
                        There may be other areas where this can be given to such as Arceros’ Melee Defense however this is the most optimal stat.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Item</h3>
                    <p>Loomians can run various items depending on their role however for Arceros, two come to mind very quickly: Fire Essence and Rageful Plushie.</p>
                    <p>Fire Essence increases the damage output of all fire type moves by 20% when held meaning the 75 strength Boiling Press - on top of the 50% from Burning Rage - can become a significant threat.</p>
                    <p>Conversely, Rageful Plush makes great use of Arceros’ decent Health and massive Melee Defence to stomach Super Effective Melee attacks and gain a +2 in Melee Attack. 
                        As mentioned earlier, Loomians like Harvesect and Joltooth are able to hit Arceros with moves such as Earthquake so this can help put up a good fight against some matchups.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <!-- Defensive Set Example -->
                <button class="panel" id="DefensiveSet">Defensive Set Example</button>
                <div class="panel2">
                    <p>Introduced with Lotusun Beach in Patch 7, Barblast is one of the evolutions for Pwuff. 
                        It became an instant favorite given the utility it offered and therefore high viability, especially over its Melee-Attacking Counterpart. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Base stats</h3>
                    <p>Barblast’s defensive nature in the meta is quite obvious when you notice its 96 Health, 102 Melee Defense and 93 Ranged Defence. 
                        Though its Energy and Ranged Attack - 83 and 89 respectively - is less than preferred, they’re still usable. 
                        Barblast’s speed is at a depressing 37 but this is only expected given the maximization of bulk. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Type Effectiveness</h3>
                    <p>Barblast has a respectable 3 weaknesses (being Electric, Earth and Mind) and 5 resistances (Fire, Water, Ice, Metal and Brawler). 
                        Melee Attackers such as Kanibo, Vesperatu, Garlash and even Obsidrugon struggle against Barblast given its typing. 
                        There are some Loomians that Barblast can act as a hard check against given the scenario however these will be mentioned later on.
                    </p>
                    <p>Additionally, since Barblast is a toxic type, it has the ability to clear poison barbs from your side of the field.</p>
                    <h3>Personality</h3>
                    <p>Given Barblast excels in Melee Defense and Health, Very Robust Frail Sluggish will be used. 
                        This increases Melee Defense by 20% whilst decreasing its Melee Attack and Speed respectively by 10%. 
                        Given these two stats are below mediocre, we can afford to decrease them further. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Alternatively, we could utilize Clever in order to check Cephalops, Ikazune and many other ranged attackers that Barblast can hit for super effectiveness. 
                        However, for this demonstration, we’ll be sticking with Very Robust.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Ability</h3>
                    <p>To increase the damage output from its 89 Ranged Attack, High Explosive boosts Barblast’s explosive moves (such as Toxiblast and Water Bomb) by 50%. 
                        There is a downside to this ability where secondary effects are removed - similar to brute force - but this isn’t a massive downside. 
                        Toxic Spines, an ability that gives the chance for an attacker to be poisoned when using a contact move on Barblast, can also be used however some may find the odds of this ability not worth it. 
                        Nevertheless, we’ll go ahead with the Secret Ability. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Movepool</h3>
                    <p>Barblast isn’t short of moves when it comes to its movepool. 
                        Since we are using High Explosive, Toxiblast and Water Bomb are the most obvious choices for ATB. 
                        Because This is a defensive loomian, recovery is a must. Rejuvenate will be chosen because of the high amount of health it can return. 
                    </p> 
                    <p>   
                        Finally, for the fourth move, various utility moves can be used but - disappointingly - we can’t choose them all. 
                        Poison helps cripple and break down Loomians who stand in Barblast’s way while Icicle Traps help exert pressure due to limiting swap-ins. Power Focus allows Barblast to set up allowing it to hit harder and make it less likely to hit weakly. This set will use Power Focus however any of the three are valid
                    </p>
                    <h3>Training Points</h3>
                    <p>200 Health and 200 Melee Defense naturally seems the way to go with Barblast given how Melee Bulky we want it to be, allowing it to soak up as much damage as possible from previously mentioned melee attackers.</p>
                    <p>Despite a somewhat suboptimal energy stat, we can invest 60 Training Points into Energy to reach 250 Total Points which enables Barblast to use 3 Rejuvenates, 3 Water Bombs and 1 Toxiblast. 
                        250 is a great benchmark energy stats so this strategy can be applied to a plethora of Loomians. 
                    </p>  
                    <p>As for the remaining 40 TPs, we can insert them into the Ranged Defense stat in order to increase our bulk on the less defensive side; investing into the Ranged Attack stat is also an option.</p>

                    <p>There’s a few options to our disposal when it comes to what Barblast will be holding. 
                        Energy Orb is very helpful to conserve energy and reduce the energy cost of your moves, especially since Barblast will click Rejuvenate, a move with 72 energy cost, quite often. 
                        If preserving energy isn’t a worry for you, Heavy Armour helps strengthen Barblast’s Melee Defense. 
                        This will hinder your energy stat leading to only 3 Rejuvenates being available at 250 energy so keep this in mind. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Relating to the type effectiveness section, Barblast can find itself in tricky matchups while being able to hit the opponent super effectively i.e. Ikazune, Harvesect and Cephalops. 
                        In these situations, the corresponding pearl - which halves the strength of a move of the corresponding type - can enable Barblast to sustain itself and win in a 1v1. 
                        Be cautious, since pearls are a one-use item.
