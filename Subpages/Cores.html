                    </div>
                    <p>A formidable duo, these Loomians alone have great coverage preventing many walls from swapping in 
                        without taking a huge hit and together this offensive pressure only becomes scarier. 
                        Shawchi can comfortably use Pyrokinesis without concern for the likes of Searknight or 
                        Eleguana as Halvantic can hit them for SE using its STAB and almost-STAB Gnarly Gash. 
                        Given these two are quite slow, frail Loomians, Boots can quicken Halvantic while speed control/pivots help both get onto the field to cause chaos.

                    </div>
                    <p>Falkyrie plus Ursoul is best known for their combination of offensive moves giving very limited answers at any time. 
                        Falkyrie is able to set up Radiant Forecast and then swap (or rather pivot) into Ursoul to apply pressure as 
                        no Loomian can swap in without taking at least a neutral hit. 
                        Ursoul is also able to hit ranged tanks that would usually come in on Falkyrie as its high Matk is quite threatening 
                        especially when many are weak to the likes of Slap Down or Pep Jab/Quick Punch.

                <button class="panel">Protogon + Umbrat (ProtoBrat)</button>
                <div class="panel2">
                    <div class="container">
                        <img src="../PVPImages/LoomianModels/Protogon-model.webp">
                        <img src="../PVPImages/LoomianModels/Umbrat-model.webp">
                    </div>
                    <p>Initially, Protogon loved being paired up with Ursoul to make use of Chase Down to involuntary incapacitate ranged walls 
                        however, ever since the Chase Down nerf, all but one user became less scary: Umbrat. 
                        This often overlooked rat has Overshadow allowing Chase Down to once again become dark type. 
                        Umbrat has far from a good MAtk stat by todays standard but the boost from Overshadow as well as Chase Down's swap out 
                        bonus has allowed it to shine back into the light once more. Similar to FalkSoul, this core appreciates hazards for that extra damage 
                        as well as speed control/pivot for safe manoeuvring.
                    </p>

                <button class="panel">Nevermare + Searknight (NeverKnight)</button>
                <div class="panel2">
                    <div class="container">
                        <img src="../PVPImages/LoomianModels/Nevermare-model.webp">
                        <img src="../PVPImages/LoomianModels/Searknight-model.webp">
                    </div>
                    <p>This is core is best explained as "What X doesn't answer, Y does". 
                        Searknight is commonly recognised as a solid answer to Nevermare so naturally pairing it up with 
                        its counterpart helps expand attack coverage. 
                        An answer to opposing Searknights and Chartikis are appreciated.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <button class="panel">Kanibo + Joltooth (KaniTooth)</button>

                    <div class="container">

                    </div>
                    <p>Also known as Double Ambush, this core gets its name from the mutual ability: Ambush. 
                        Similar to the Move Chase Down, this ability allows moves to deal double the damage if a Loomian has been swapped in. 
                        This can help break down answers to both Loomians allowing for solid progression. 
                        Pivot support, Speed Control and Barbs to further break down Loomians is appreciated.
                    </p>

                <button class="panel">Zuelong + Barbadger (ZueBadger)</button>

                    <div class="container">

                    </div>
                    <p>Similar to ProtoBrat, Zuelong can be answered by a variety of ranged walls 
                        however Barbadger makes use of this by being a melee wallbreaker. 
                        As a bonus, Dauntless (which gives a +1 MAtk if the opponent has an SE move) makes it easier to 
                        break common Zuelong answers like Pyrolen or Sedimars. 
                        Barbs plus Slow Pivot support helps make the most of this core. 
                    </p>

                <div class="panel2">
                    <div class="container">
                        <img src="../PVPImages/LoomianModels/Falkyrie-model.webp">
                        <img src="../PVPImages/LoomianModels/Ursnac-model.webp">
                    </div>
                    <p>You've heard of FalkSoul now get ready for FalkSnac. 
                        Falkyrie's Base Speed stat is far from perfect, especially when the meta is using faster and faster Loomians. 
                        Ursnac solves this problem with its Pivot move Baffle. 
                        Not only does this allow Ursnac to swap out without wasting a turn (allowing it act as a defensive pivot), 
                        The opponent's speed stat is decreased by 1 stage allowing Falkyrie to outspeed a plethora of Loomians. 
                        From there, Falkyrie can come in and start setting up and breaking down Loomians. 
                        Ursnac also has access to Slap Down to hit plant types that would usually answer Falkyrie such as Mawamurk.

                <button class="panel">Wresolen + Taoshinu (WresoTao)</button>

                    </div>
                    <p>Toashinu is best recognised as an adequate bequeather making use of sharpen and even a Rageful Plushie. 
                        Once setted up, This Loomian can pass on its somewhat concerning Matk stat to a more fearful utiliser: Wresolen. 
                        A reliable answer to mind types is preferred as well as Cosmiore can be inserted to make use of Ace once Wresolen has done its job.

                <button class="panel">Luminami + Boarrok (BoarNami)</button>
                <div class="panel2">
                    <div class="container">

                        <img src="../PVPImages/LoomianModels/Boarrok-model.webp">
                    </div>
                    <p>Luminami is best recognised as a defensive pivot making us of its natural bulk, flash n' flee and its passive recovery through Power Napper. 
                        That being said, it can be paired up with virtually any frail Loomian who needs extra support when entering the battlefield. 
                        This variation pairs Luminami up with Boarrok so it can collect a +1 Matk and start rampaging. 
                        Answers to Wintrix, Deludrix, Kanibo and many other SE Loomians are appreciated.
                    </p>

                <button class="panel">Bunnecki + Stratusoar (StratuNecki)</button>
                <div class="panel2">
                    <div class="container">

                    </div>
                    <p>It's no secret that Bunnecki isn't a favourable Loomian to use due to a sub-optimal stat spread and questionable movesets however 
                        there are some benefits that players may enjoy and Stratusoar can make it all the easier to use. 
                        Stratusoar helps bait out electric type loomians to dish out electric type attacks making it easier for bunnecki to enter the field and 
                        start its rampage. Stratusoar also offers hazard removal with gust which can clear the likes of icicle traps allowing bunnecki to swap in chip-free.

                <button class="panel">Nymaurae + Eruptidon (NymErupt)</button>

                    </div>
                    <p>Nymaurae can assert offensive pressure with a support-oriented set making it all the easier to pair it with a nuke such as Eruptidon. 
                        Eruptidon's best strengths can be attributed to being able to set up to use its amazing coverage of moves. 
                        From there, it can start wallbreaking and swap into Nymaurae once Loomians are within KO range. 
                        As a plus, Eruptidon can melts icicle traps which Nymaurae is weak to.

                    </div>
                    <p>A very classic defensive core, as well variations such as OxiNamiSwol or OxiNamiToad, 
                        this also follows the principle of "What X doesn't answer, Y does" by covering eachothers 
                        weaknesses based on resistances and attack moves. 
                        Furthermore, Luminami provides slow pivot support while Oxidrake can use driving force to 
                        shuffle around the opponent's team. A barbs setter or offensive Loomian works well with this core. 
                        The addition of Swolder and Meditoad to the core can help provide speed control via tase/webbing, slap down, poison as well as (poison) barbs removal.

                    </div>
                    <p>This somewhat recent defensive core covers against the majority of Melee Attackers by 
                        utilising resistances. For example, Wresolen - who can break through tundrolen - 
                        can be dealt easily with barblast and Joltooth - which is SE against Barblast - 
                        can be stopped by Tundrolen. 
                        As you might have guessed, Ranged Attackers do invalidate this core especially Gummy Fiscarna 
                        who is immune to highly explosive Barblast.

                    </div>
                    <p>Better known as Double Napper, this core abuses the mutual ability Power Napper by 
                        recovering health whenever swapping out. 
                        This allows for safe exchanging knowing your main core has gotten some of their health back. 
                        Luminami provides pivot support as always while Infernix can provide speed control, 
                        hazard removal or deal crazy damage back with Return to Sender.

                    </div>
                    <p>Quite a controversial core, Ventacean and Venolen were once Loomians with 
                        the highest Mdef and Rdef respectively which meant people tried using them together. 
                        While the theme is understandable, A great hand of Loomians are able to break this core so 
                        don't expect anything powerful coming from this duo.

                    <p>A quick glance of Obsidrugon's weaknesses shows light ancient and metal with 
                        a lot of Loomians who share this type being ranged attackers. 
                        Tyrecks has been acknowledged for its great defensive typing allowing it to 
                        stay in and hit the likes of Falkyrie or Tiklipse. 
                        It also has the Melee Bulk to answer some Melee Attackers, 
                        that Obsidrugon may be unable to, such as Halvantic. 
                        Some Loomians like Ikazune, Luminami, Whippledriff (generally Ranged Attackers that hit Tyrecks for SE) 
                        can break through this core so add to it accordingly.
