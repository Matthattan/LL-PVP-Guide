    <p>A Core is when 2 or More Loomians that support each other well, are combined. 
        In other words, they have good synergy with each other whether that be offensively, defensively or both. 
        Cores are great for starting off the creation of a team because it saves time by focusing on several Loomians, 
        allows you to closely analyze how Loomians work with each other and can save time by looking at pre-existing cores. 
    </p>
    <p>For example, Magamadire-Eruptidon and Ursnac have proven to be such a threatening core due to the speed control and defensive utility offered by Ursnac 
        and Insane Coverage and Damage Output credited to Magamadire-Eruptudon. 
        This toxic mix of Loomians that do well for their roles resulted in a change of Baffleâ€™s effect and agmadire-Eruptidon's Soul Burst Move.

                        Falkyrie's Base Speed stat is far from perfect, especially when the meta is using faster and faster Loomians. 
                        Ursnac solves this problem with its Pivot move Baffle. Not only does this allow Ursnac to swap out without wasting a turn (allowing it act as a defensive pivot), 
                        The opponent's speed stat is decreased by 1 stage allowing Fmattalkyrie to outspeed a plethora of Loomians. 
                        From there, Falkyrie can come in and start setting up and breaking down Loomians.

                        Pyrolen offers a good answer for meta ranged attackers and provides hazard removal through Burn-Up while Luminami is staple when it comes to Melee Defensive Loomians.
