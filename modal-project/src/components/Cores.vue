    <p>A Core is when 2 or More Loomians that support each other well, are combined. 
        In other words, they have good synergy with each other whether that be offensively, defensively or both. 
        Cores are great for starting off the creation of a team because it saves time by focusing on several Loomians, 
        allows you to closely analyze how Loomians work with each other and can save time by looking at pre-existing cores. 
    </p>
    <p>For example, Magamadire-Eruptidon and Ursnac have proven to be such a threatening core due to the speed control and defensive utility offered by Ursnac 
        and Insane Coverage and Damage Output credited to Magamadire-Eruptudon. 
        This toxic mix of Loomians that do well for their roles resulted in a change of Baffleâ€™s effect and Magmadire-Eruptidon's Soul Burst Move.

                        First off, both Luminami and Icigool are defensive pivots (with Icigool also having speed control) allowing a chance for Offensive Loomians to enter the battlefield easier. 
                        Pyrolen offers a good answer for meta ranged attackers and provides hazard removal through Burn-Up while Luminami is staple when it comes to Melee Defensive Loomians. 
                        As a plus, decent offensive pressure is emitted from the three. `,

                        Furthermore, Luminami provides slow pivot support while Oxidrake can use driving force to shuffle around the opponent's team. 
                        A barbs setter or offensive Loomian works well with this core. 
                        The addition of Swolder and Meditoad to the core can help provide speed control via tase/webbing, slap down, poison as well as (poison) barbs removal.  `,

                        As you might have guessed, Ranged Attackers do invalidate this core especially Gummy Fiscarna who is immune to highly explosive Barblast. `,

                        Gargolem Defense also has access to Mudslide (for hazard removal) and Slap Down to disable a Loomians capability. 
                        Adding a Late-Game Sweeper helps clear the field faster as well as adding pressure through speed. `,
