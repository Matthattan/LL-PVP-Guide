        <h1 id="What">What is Rally Ranch?</h1>
        <p> Rally Ranch is a sub-location on Route 6 where Players can give Loomians to an NPC in order to produce more Loomians. 
            Rally Ranch can take up to 2 Loomians (A Rally Leader and A Rally Assistant) and has room for 3 Loomians to be rallied at any one time.
        </p>
        <h1 id="Why">Why is Rally Ranch used?</h1>
        <p> Firstly, Rallied Loomians have access to Totemised Personalities which means 3 personalities instead of the regular 2 personalities (or even one). 
            Having access to more personalities helps increase stats, making Loomians increasingly viable.
            Another reason to use Rally Ranch is greater control over a Loomianâ€™s UPs. 
            Whether it be maximising all stats or wanting to decrease a certain stat, Rally Ranch offers items to pass down Unique Points.
