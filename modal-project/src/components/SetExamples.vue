Ironically, this vast movepool is actually a disadvantage because Charonyx can’t run all the moves it would like to run simultaneously.

Energy Orb is very helpful to conserve energy and reduce the energy cost of your moves, especially since Barblast will click Rejuvenate, a move with 72 energy cost, quite often. If preserving energy isn’t a worry for you, Heavy Armour helps strengthen Barblast’s Melee Defense. This will hinder your energy stat leading to only 3 Rejuvenates being available at 250 energy so keep this in mind.`,

In these situations, the respective pearl - which halves the strength of a move of the corresponding type - can enable Barblast to sustain itself and win in a 1v1.

                        `Despite appearing right at the beginning of the game, Gastroak was considered as an absolute failure and was largely forgotten by the community; however, with the introduction of Soul Burst, it shot up in usage due to its elite utility as a defensive Loomian.`,
                        `Terraform-Gastroak’s base stats are a breathtaking upgrade from its normal form. A 140 Health stat, along with a 140 Ranged Defence stat, allows it to sponge many hits. It has a respectable Ranged Attack stat of 105 and an adequate energy stat of 88. On the other hand, Terraform-Gastroak’s Melee side is quite middling with a 60 Melee Attack stat and 45 Melee Defence stat but this is fine, due to Gastroak not needing to rely on them. As for its 65 Speed stat, it's a fair compromise given its monstrous stats. `,

Conversely, Terraform-Gastroak has a 2x weakness to Fire, Dark and Bug and a quad weakness to Ice (Though this will be further touched upon in the Ability section).`,

                        `Given its incredibly bulky nature by having a high Health and Ranged Defense stat, Terraform-Gastroak can use Very Clever Frail Sluggish. Terraform-Gastroak also has the utility to support this type of set. The negative personalities are chosen because they’re low and therefore won’t be used much.`,
                        `Terraform-Gastroak has access to only one ability: Insulated which not only turns its quad weakness to ice into a normal weakness but also makes Fire type attacks neutral. Despite this, it's recommended to run Ungracious Host as a normal Gastroak to deter any health-draining move.`,

Tamp, which increases its Melee Defence and Ranged Defence, is also helpful in making Gastroak deal more damage with stratagem whilst also improving its Defence stats`,

                        `Lastly, Photosynthesis is a must-have on Gastroak just like how any other defensive Loomians likes reliable recovery. As a bonus, it has an animation allowing you to animation stall in front of your opponent.`,
