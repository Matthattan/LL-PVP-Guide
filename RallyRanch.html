                <h3>What is Rally Ranch?</h3>
                <p> Rally Ranch is a Location in Loomian Legacy that allows Players to collect new Loomians based on their own Loomians that have been given to the Ranch. It is located on route 6, gives you 3 starting spaces to collect Loomians from and Tools to enhance Rallying can be earned through Mastery.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph1">
                <h3>As a PVPer, Why should I use this?</h3>
                <p> With Rallying, Loomians you obtain can get 3 Personalities (known as a Totemised Personality) which means 3 stats of a Loomian are changed instead of 2 personalities (or even one). This is a great advantage for Loomians to utilise as it allows 2 stats to gain a boost or even 1 stat to gain a massive increase. </p>
                <p>Another reason to use Rally Ranch is to get Loomians with natural 7x40 UPs. This helps maximise stats that a Loomian may want to take advantage of such as Speed or their dominant Attacking stat.</p>
                <p>Many Loomians have moves that are learnt exclusively through Rallying. For example, Shawchi is able to run Elememtal Burst however it does not learn this by Level up. Instead, You need to put Shawchi in the assistant slot of Rally Ranch and a Loomian that already knows Elemental Burst (such as Zuelong). If the Shawchi has free space in its moveslot, and has been over a minute, then it will have successfully learn Elemental Burst once you check on your leader and assistant slot.
                    For more information about learning Rally Moves <a>see here</a>.</p>

                <h3>What Items does Rally Ranch offer?</h3>
                <p> Rally Ranch offers Feeds which changes what Unique Points your Rallied Loomians will inherit, Toys which change what personality your Rallied Loomians inherit and Totems that change the type of Personality your Rallied Loomians will obtain.</p>
