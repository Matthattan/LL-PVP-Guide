                            <p>A formidable duo, these Loomians alone have great coverage preventing many walls from swapping in 
                                without taking a huge hit and together this offensive pressure only becomes scarier. 
                                Shawchi can comfortably use Pyrokinesis without concern for the likes of Searknight or 
                                Eleguana as Halvantic can hit them for SE using its STAB and almost-STAB Gnarly Gash. 
                                Given these two are quite slow, frail Loomians, Boots can quicken Halvantic while speed control/pivots help both get onto the field to cause chaos.

                            <p>Falkyrie plus Ursoul is best known for their combination of offensive moves giving very limited answers at any time. 
                                Falkyrie is able to set up Radiant Forecast and then swap (or rather pivot) into Ursoul to apply pressure as 
                                no Loomian can swap in without taking at least a neutral hit. 
                                Ursoul is also able to hit ranged tanks that would usually come in on Falkyrie as its high Matk is quite threatening 
                                especially when many are weak to the likes of Slap Down or Pep Jab/Quick Punch.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <button class="panel">Protogon + Umbrat (ProtoBrat)</button>
                        <div class="panel2">
                            <div class="container">
                                <img src="../PVPImages/LoomianModels/Protogon-model.webp">
                                <img src="../PVPImages/LoomianModels/Umbrat-model.webp">
                            </div>
                            <p>Initially, Protogon loved being paired up with Ursoul to make use of Chase Down to involuntary incapacitate ranged walls 
                                however, ever since the Chase Down nerf, all but one user became less scary: Umbrat. 
                                This often overlooked rat has Overshadow allowing Chase Down to once again become dark type. 
                                Umbrat has far from a good MAtk stat by todays standard but the boost from Overshadow as well as Chase Down's swap out 
                                bonus has allowed it to shine back into the light once more. Similar to FalkSoul, this core appreciates hazards for that extra damage 
                                as well as speed control/pivot for safe manoeuvring.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <button class="panel">Nevermare + Searknight (NeverKnight)</button>
                        <div class="panel2">
                            <div class="container">

                            </div>
                            <p>This is core is best explained as "What X doesn't answer, Y does". 
                                Searknight is commonly recognised as a solid answer to Nevermare so naturally pairing it up with 
                                its counterpart helps expand attack coverage. 
                                An answer to opposing Searknights and Chartikis are appreciated.
                            </p>

                        <button class="panel">Kanibo + Joltooth (KaniTooth)</button>
                        <div class="panel2">
                            <div class="container">

                            <p>Also known as Double Ambush, this core gets its name from the mutual ability: Ambush. 
                                Similar to the Move Chase Down, this ability allows moves to deal double the damage if a Loomian has been swapped in. 
                                This can help break down answers to both Loomians allowing for solid progression. 
                                Pivot support, Speed Control and Barbs to further break down Loomians is appreciated.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <button class="panel">Zuelong + Barbadger (ZueBadger)</button>
                        <div class="panel2">
                            <div class="container">

                            </div>
                            <p>Similar to ProtoBrat, Zuelong can be answered by a variety of ranged walls 
                                however Barbadger makes use of this by being a melee wallbreaker. 
                                As a bonus, Dauntless (which gives a +1 MAtk if the opponent has an SE move) makes it easier to 
                                break common Zuelong answers like Pyrolen or Sedimars. 
                                Barbs plus Slow Pivot support helps make the most of this core.

                            <p>Deludrix does what Deludrix does and abuses its absurd collage of coverage by taking on Gargolem-D and Stratusoar 
                                while (Idiosyncratic) Pharoglyph can break Venolen, Taoshinu and Icigool. 
                                A defensive pivot is much appreciated to get either Offensive Loomian into the field and start their chaos.

                            <div class="container">

                            </div>
                            <p>In conjuction with Wresolen's Ace, Cosmiore-Unleashed can enter the field 
                                once Wresolen is down and make use of its doubled power. 
                                Common Answers to Cosmiore such as Stratusoar don't want to stay in long 
                                due to the colossal damage output compared to non-Ace Cosmiore. 
                                Wresolen can also break down defensive answers to Cosmiore 
                                before dropping out in order to make Cos-U's job a lot easier. 
                                This core offers very limited answers however some people may pair up Cosmiore-Unleashed with another Loomian.

                            <div class="container">

                            <p>To an extent, think of this as an upgrade from AceMiore. 
                                Specilization Meditoad beholds high potential damage with 1 or 2 moves that form deadly coverage. 
                                Once passed onto Cos-U, Stratusoar, Tyrecks and Tiklipse do NOT want to pick a fight with it. 
                                Giving Cosmiore Boots to abuse the single move it has helps with speed control 
                                while Meditoad can carry Mega Punch for those who resist its Psycho Blast.

                            <p>Samarine has a blatant 4x eletric weakness, thats quite obvious. 
                                However, we can turn this into a good thing by pairing Samarine with Bunnecki. 
                                With its Electric (and Light) Immunity, Bunnecki can come in freely when an electric attack is immininent. 
                                From there, Bunnecki can set up and start attacking. 
                                An answer to toxic types is appreciated as well a pivot to get either Loomian in.

                            <p>You've heard of FalkSoul now get ready for FalkSnac. 
                                Falkyrie's Base Speed stat is far from perfect, especially when the meta is using faster and faster Loomians. 
                                Ursnac solves this problem with its Pivot move Baffle. 
                                Not only does this allow Ursnac to swap out without wasting a turn (allowing it act as a defensive pivot), 
                                The opponent's speed stat is decreased by 1 stage allowing Falkyrie to outspeed a plethora of Loomians. 
                                From there, Falkyrie can come in and start setting up and breaking down Loomians. 
                                Ursnac also has access to Slap Down to hit plant types that would usually answer Falkyrie such as Mawamurk.

                                Once setted up, This Loomian can pass on its somewhat concerning Matk stat to a more fearful utiliser: Wresolen. 
                                A reliable answer to mind types is preferred as well as Cosmiore can be inserted to make use of Ace once Wresolen has done its job.

                            <p>Luminami is best recognised as a defensive pivot making us of its natural bulk, flash n' flee and its passive recovery through Power Napper. 
                                That being said, it can be paired up with virtually any frail Loomian who needs extra support when entering the battlefield. 
                                This variation pairs Luminami up with Boarrok so it can collect a +1 Matk and start rampaging. 
                                Answers to Wintrix, Deludrix, Kanibo and many other SE Loomians are appreciated.

                            <p>It's no secret that Bunnecki isn't a favourable Loomian to use due to a sub-optimal stat spread and questionable movesets however 
                                there are some benefits that players may enjoy and Stratusoar can make it all the easier to use. 
                                Stratusoar helps bait out electric type loomians to dish out electric type attacks making it easier for bunnecki to enter the field and 
                                start its rampage. Stratusoar also offers hazard removal with gust which can clear the likes of icicle traps allowing bunnecki to swap in chip-free.

                                Eruptidon's best strengths can be attributed to being able to set up to use its amazing coverage of moves. 
                                From there, it can start wallbreaking and swap into Nymaurae once Loomians are within KO range. 
                                As a plus, Eruptidon can melts icicle traps which Nymaurae is weak to.

                                weaknesses based on resistances and attack moves. 
                                Furthermore, Luminami provides slow pivot support while Oxidrake can use driving force to 
                                shuffle around the opponent's team. A barbs setter or offensive Loomian works well with this core. 
                                The addition of Swolder and Meditoad to the core can help provide speed control via tase/webbing, slap down, poison as well as (poison) barbs removal.

                                can be stopped by Tundrolen. 
                                As you might have guessed, Ranged Attackers do invalidate this core especially Gummy Fiscarna 
                                who is immune to highly explosive Barblast.

                                hazard removal or deal crazy damage back with Return to Sender.

                                Tyrecks has been acknowledged for its great defensive typing allowing it to

                                Pyrolen offers a good answer for meta ranged attackers and provides hazard removal through Burn-Up 
                                while Luminami is staple when it comes to Melee Defensive Loomians.
